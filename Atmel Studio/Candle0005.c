/*
	09/21/13 - Reversed matrix lookup table to cancel out mirrored physical boards. Boards got mirrored accidentally and easier to change software than reprint.
	09/22/13 - Reversed the rowDirectionBits to fix the mess caused by the previous change. Argh.  
	09/26/13 - First GitHub commit
	10/16/13 - Added test mode on that will show a test pattern on power-up.
